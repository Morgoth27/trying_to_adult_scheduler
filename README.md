# trying_to_adult_scheduler
A daily business hours scheduler to help you remain organized.

This is a daily scheduler to help you organize your day. If the event time has passed, you will see a gray time slot. If it is occurring or about to pass, it will be red. And finally, for future events during your day they will show as green. 

To log each item within a time slot, simply type the text into the empty field and hit save to the right.

Once your day has concluded, there is a button to clear your entries so you may start anew!
